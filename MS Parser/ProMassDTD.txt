XML Output File

ProMass automatically writes an XML summary file during automatic processing.  
The file is called promass_results.xml and is written to the results directory.  
The XML file contains all the relevant information about each sample processed from the Xcalibur sample list.  
The XML file represents a convenient way to import ProMass results into a database. 
 An example annotated XML file is included with the installation in the ProMass install directory so that you can see 
 what a typical ProMass XML output file would look like.  See the file called promass_annotated.xml.  
 The file is reproduced below, with the comments about each XML element or node shown in green text.
